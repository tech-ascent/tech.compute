(ns tech.compute.tensor
  "Tensor library used to implement the basic math abstraction in cortex.  This
  abstraction is meant to provide a language in which to implement new things but that
  explicitly avoids access to certain parts of the compute ecosystem that the engine
  driving the ecosystem is expected to manage.  Clients should not, for instance, access
  the stream or the datatype directly.

There is an implicit assumption throughout this file that implementations will loop
  through smaller entities instead of throwing an exception if sizes don't match.  This
  is referred to as broadcasting in numpy
  (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html).

It does mean, however, that certain conditions that would actually be error cases are
  harder to detect because one has to check for remainders being zero (which potentially
  could cause a divide by zero error) instead of just checking for equality.


For binary operations there are four forms:

y = a*x op b*y
result = a*x op b*y.
y[idx] = a*x[idx] op b*y[idx]
result[idx] = a*x[idx] op b*y[idx]

Op may be: [:+ :* :/].

In the non-indexed cases the element counts of y or x may differ but they need to be
  commensurate meaning that the smaller evenly divides the larger.  When writing to
  result it is important that result is as large as the largest.  This is a relaxation
  of the numpy broadcasting rules to allow more forms of broadcasting; the check is that
  the remainder is zero; not that the smaller dimension is 1.


In general we want as much error checking and analysis done in this file as opposed to
  at the implementation level (compute stream level) so that different implementations
  of this duplicate the least number of possible operations and so their edge cases
  agree to the extent possible."
