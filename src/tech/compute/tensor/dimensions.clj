  "Compute tensors dimensions control the shape and stride of the tensor along with
  offsetting into the actual data buffer.  This allows multiple backends to share a
  single implementation of a system that will allow transpose, reshape, etc. assuming
  the backend correctly interprets the shape and stride of the dimension objects.

  Shape vectors may have an index buffer in them at a specific dimension instead of a
  number.  This means that that dimension should be indexed indirectly.  If a shape has
  any index buffers then it is considered an indirect shape."
